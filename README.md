## AI tasks

Welcome to a project designed to upgrade your learning process! Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly common, and while they can be powerful, just asking them for answers won’t help you grow. This project focuses on teaching you how to use AI strategically as a learning partner.

You probably already know how to search for information online. But as a learner aiming for deeper understanding, especially in technical fields, you need to leverage tools in smarter ways. Instead of just getting code or summaries handed to you, you’ll learn how to prompt AI effectively to help you grasp complex concepts, visualize processes, understand code logic, and overcome specific learning hurdles.

In this project, you’ll explore your own learning style and discover how different AI tools and techniques can be tailored to help you learn more efficiently and effectively, using Bash piping as a practical example. 

### By now you must have known your learning style.

Now that you have an idea of your learning style, let’s look at how specific AI tools can help you. Forget generic lists! We’re focusing on matching the tool to the learning challenge. This task is about understanding the possibilities before you dive in for the main event in Task 4.

**Your Instructions**:

Review the following AI strategies matched to learning challenges/styles:

**Challenge**: *Understanding complex texts/notes (Read/Write learners): Tools like NotebookLM or Claude can summarize long documents, let you ask questions about the text, and help extract key themes*.

- Good Prompt Example: `Explain the concept of asynchronous programming from this document in simple terms, using an analogy`.
- Bad Prompt Example: `Write a summary of this document`. (Too passive!)

**Challenge**: *Visualizing abstract concepts or processes (Visual learners): Tools like Napkin.AI, or even asking LLMs like Gemini or ChatGPT to generate descriptions for diagrams can help. Some AI can even generate simple diagrams directly.*

- Good Prompt Example: `Describe the steps of the Gitflow workflow in a way that I could draw it as a flowchart.`
- Bad Prompt Example:`Make a diagram about Gitflow`. (Too vague!)

**Challenge**: *Understanding, debugging, or experimenting with code (Kinaesthetic/Practical learners): Tools with Code Interpreter (like ChatGPT’s feature or Google’s tool) or Canvas features are amazing*. You can paste code, ask for explanations line-by-line, ask “what if” questions, get debugging help, or even run code snippets.

- Good Prompt Example: `Explain this Python function line by line. What does the yield keyword do here? If I changed X to Y, what would happen?`
- Bad Prompt Example: `Fix this code`. (Doesn’t help you learn why it was broken!)

**Challenge**: *Grasping info from videos/lectures (Auditory/Visual learners): Some AI tools can process YouTube transcripts or video content to provide summaries or answer questions*.

- Good Prompt Example: `Summarize the key points about CSS Flexbox discussed between 5:00 and 10:00 in this video tutorial [link]`.
    Bad Prompt Example: `Tell me about Flexbox`.

Think about which of these strategies might be most helpful for your learning style and the subjects you study.

__Requirements__:

Write and post about your interaction with the appropriate AI tool you’ve chosen and also why you chose it.
